# Cubari Importer

Convert your manga app backups to RemoteStorage objects for Cubari

## Production app

Go [here](https://cubari.kingbri.dev) to access the public website

## Why did we make this?

I really like manga apps... I really do, but they can be a huge pain to work with especially if you lose your device.

Some manga apps are also frustrating to use and get pulled often. However, websites have a much rarer chance of dying, especially if they're a proxy for another website.

Enter [Cubari](https://cubari.moe). This is a website created by the [Guya project](https://github.com/appu1232/guyamoe/) for people to read manga with ease.

## Ok... but this isn't Cubari

That's right. However, I had to give some background information.

Cubari has a system to store history which uses a protocol called [RemoteStorage](https://remotestorage.io/).

This tool leverages RemoteStorage by converting your manga app backup into objects which can be imported into your RemoteStorage library.

## Usage

1. Connect your RemoteStorage account with the widget
2. Click the button pertaining to your manga app
3. Upload your backup file
4. Open devtools and navigate to `Console`
5. See the output

## Running yourself

1. Clone the project
2. Run `yarn install` to add all packages (you can also use npm)
3. Run `yarn dev` to immediately start up the next server

## Contribution
